## MD5 Hash Cracking
**Goal:** Demonstrate the process of creating a test MD5 password hash, cracking it with John the Ripper, and verifying the result.

---

### 1: Create a Test Hash File
First, I created a dummy user and assigned them a known MD5 password hash.  
This simulates having extracted a hash from a system for testing purposes.
Command: echo "dummyuser:5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99" > hash.txt

### 2: Crack the Hash with John the Ripper
I then fed the hash file into John the Ripper, explicitly defining the format (`raw-md5`) so John parses and cracks it correctly.  
The `--wordlist` option points to `rockyou.txt`, a common password dictionary used for penetration testing and training.
Command: john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

### 3: Display the Cracked Credentials
Finally, I used Johnâ€™s `--show` option to neatly display the cracked password in `username:password` format.  
This makes it easier to confirm credentials at a glance.
Command: john --show --format=raw-md5 hash.txt
